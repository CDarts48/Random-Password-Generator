# Random-Password-Generator 

#Description
I created this project because I wanted to explore how JS works creating a call and response in order to make a random password generator. 

#Authors and acknowledgments 
I received help from Corey Yates, the tutor from boot camp spot as well as my friend Ben Wyess. When I got stuck I triangulated answers from Github copilot, ChatGPT and Stack Overflow.

#Use 
Click the "Gennerate Password" Button to start the program. You will then go through a series of promps that will create a password using your prefrences.
