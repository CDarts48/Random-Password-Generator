# Random-Password-Generator 

#Description
I created this project because I wanted to explore how JS works creating a call and response in order to make a random password generator. 

#Authors and acknowledgments 
I received help from Corey, the tutor from boot camp spot as well as my friend Ben Wyess. When I got stuck I triangulated answers from Github copilot, ChatGPT and Stack Overflow.
